# SuperShadersSuite-UZDoom
A collection of shaders for Doom designed to run with Doom mods that already include Motion Blur (mblur), such as Project Brutality, Brutal Doom, Enhanced Vanilla Project and so on.

Motion Blur provided separately if the mod you are playing does not include it.  Load this before the Shaders pack.
